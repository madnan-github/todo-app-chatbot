# Feature Specification: Console Todo CRUD Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-console-todo-crud`
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft
**Phase**: Phase I - In-Memory Python Console App

## Overview

A command-line todo application that allows users to manage personal tasks through a text-based menu interface. The application stores tasks in memory during each session, providing basic task management capabilities as the foundation for future phases.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add a New Task (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add a new task with a title and optional description so that I can track things I need to do.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - without the ability to add tasks, no other features have value. This is the foundation of the entire application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application, selecting "Add task", entering task details, and verifying the task appears in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** I select "Add task" and enter a valid title, **Then** a new task is created with status "pending" and a confirmation message is displayed.
2. **Given** I am adding a task, **When** I provide both title and description, **Then** both are saved and displayed when viewing tasks.
3. **Given** I am adding a task, **When** I provide only a title (no description), **Then** the task is created successfully with an empty description.
4. **Given** I am adding a task, **When** I enter an empty title, **Then** an error message is displayed and no task is created.

---

### User Story 2 - View All Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see all my tasks in a formatted list so that I can understand what I need to do.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability - users must see their tasks to manage them. Without this, users cannot verify their actions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding sample tasks and selecting "View tasks" to see a formatted table showing all tasks with their details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tasks exist, **When** I select "View tasks", **Then** I see a formatted table showing task ID, title, completion status, and creation date.
2. **Given** no tasks exist, **When** I select "View tasks", **Then** I see a friendly message indicating no tasks are available.
3. **Given** tasks exist with mixed completion status, **When** I view tasks, **Then** completed tasks show a checkmark indicator and pending tasks show a circle indicator.

---

### User Story 3 - Mark Task as Complete (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to mark a task as complete so that I can track my progress.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - task completion is the primary purpose of a todo app. Users need immediate feedback on accomplishing tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding a task, marking it complete by ID, and verifying the status changes in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pending task exists, **When** I select "Mark complete" and enter the task ID, **Then** the task status changes to completed with a confirmation message.
2. **Given** a task is already completed, **When** I try to mark it complete again, **Then** I see a message indicating it is already completed.
3. **Given** I enter a non-existent task ID, **When** I try to mark it complete, **Then** I see an error message that the task was not found.

---

### User Story 4 - Update Task Details (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to update the title or description of an existing task so that I can correct mistakes or add information.

**Why this priority**: Important but not critical for MVP - tasks can be deleted and re-added as a workaround. Improves user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding a task, selecting "Update task", providing the task ID and new values, and verifying changes appear in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task exists, **When** I select "Update task", enter the ID and new title, **Then** the title is updated and a confirmation is shown.
2. **Given** a task exists, **When** I update with a new description only, **Then** only the description changes and title remains unchanged.
3. **Given** I enter an invalid task ID, **When** I try to update, **Then** I see an error message that the task was not found.
4. **Given** I am updating a task, **When** I provide an empty title, **Then** the update is rejected with an error message.

---

### User Story 5 - Delete a Task (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to delete a task I no longer need so that my task list stays relevant.

**Why this priority**: Important for maintaining a clean task list, but not critical for basic task tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding a task, selecting "Delete task", entering the task ID, and verifying it no longer appears in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task exists, **When** I select "Delete task" and enter the task ID, **Then** the task is removed and a confirmation message is displayed.
2. **Given** I enter a non-existent task ID, **When** I try to delete, **Then** I see an error message that the task was not found.
3. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** I delete one task, **Then** only that task is removed and others remain unchanged.

---

### User Story 6 - Navigate Application Menu (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to navigate through a clear menu system so that I can easily access all features.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability - without a menu, users cannot access any functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the application and verifying the menu displays numbered options and responds to user selections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application starts, **When** it loads, **Then** I see a numbered menu with all available options (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete, Exit).
2. **Given** I am at the menu, **When** I enter a valid option number, **Then** the corresponding action is performed.
3. **Given** I am at the menu, **When** I enter an invalid option, **Then** I see an error message and the menu is displayed again.
4. **Given** I am at the menu, **When** I select "Exit", **Then** the application closes gracefully with a goodbye message.

### Edge Cases

- **Empty title validation**: System rejects tasks with empty or whitespace-only titles
- **Title length limit**: Titles exceeding 200 characters are rejected with a clear error
- **Description length limit**: Descriptions exceeding 1000 characters are rejected with a clear error
- **Invalid task ID format**: Non-numeric task IDs are handled gracefully with error messages
- **Session boundary**: All tasks are lost when the application is closed (expected for Phase I)
- **Concurrent operations**: Not applicable for single-user console app
- **Special characters**: Titles and descriptions accept special characters and unicode
